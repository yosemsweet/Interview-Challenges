Welcome to the Interview-Challenges!

I've set up a simple Ruby on Rails 3.0.2 framework here and have a few challenges for you to complete.

Please create your own branch when working on solutions. I will be reviewing commit notes so please commit early and often with a short summary of what's included in the commit. Proper punctuation is not required ;)

Challenge 1 focuses on your understanding Routes, Views, and Controllers. You are free to make any changes to the code you like.

Challenge 1: Suite101 articles can be accessed as a reader and edited as a writer.

Challenge 2 looks at your understanding of some scalability techniques and your ability to modify default Rails behavior.

Challenge 2: How to make an article listing page fast?
